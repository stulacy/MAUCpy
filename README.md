# MAUCpy
Multi-Objective Area Under Curve in Python

An implementation of the MAUC measure from Hand & Till's 2001 paper *"A Simple Generalisation of the Area Under the ROC Curve for Multiple Class Classification Problems"*. This algorithm has been implemented in R in the [HandTill2001](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/HandTill2001/index.html) package, as well as [pROC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pROC/index.html), but this is the first (that I can tell) readily available Python implementation.
